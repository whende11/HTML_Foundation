        <h2>What is Web Framework</h2>
        <p>
            A <strong>Web Framework (WF)</strong> or <strong>Web Application Framework(WAF)</strong> is a software framework that is designed to support the development of web applications including web services, web resources, and web APIs. Web frameworks provide a standard way to build and deploy web applications on the World Wide Web.
        </p>
        <p>
            A <strong>Web Framework</strong> is a software tool that provides a way to build and run web applications. As a result, you don’t need to write code on your own and waste time looking for possible miscalculations and bugs.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the early days of <strong><u>Web Development</u></strong>, all applications were hand-coded, and only the developer of a certain app could change or deploy it. Web frameworks introduced a simple way out of this trap. Since 1995, all the hassle connected with changing an application’s structure has been put in order because of the appearance of a general performance. And that’s when web-specific languages appeared. Their variety is now working well for both static and dynamic web pages. You can choose one website framework that covers all your needs or merge several, depending on your task.

        <ul>
            <h2>Key components of a Web Framework:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Routing</strong>: Handles how URLs are mapped to functions or actions in the application. For example, mapping /about to a specific "About Us" page function.</li>
                <li><strong>Templating</strong>: Allows developers to dynamically generate HTML content by embedding data into pre-defined templates.</li>
                <li><strong>Request and Response Handling</strong>: Manages HTTP requests sent by users and generates corresponding HTTP responses.</li>
                <li><strong>Database Interaction</strong>: Provides tools to interact with databases through Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) or raw queries.</li>
                <li><strong>Session and State Management</strong>: Helps in maintaining user sessions and tracking their state across multiple requests.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Security</strong>: Includes features like user authentication, authorization, and protection against vulnerabilities (e.g., Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection).</li>
                <li><strong>Middleware</strong>: Offers the ability to add reusable components that process requests or responses, such as logging, compression, or authentication checks.</li>
                <li><strong>Testing and Debugging Tools</strong>: Facilitates unit testing, debugging, and error handling for smoother development.</li>
            </ol>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <h2>Types of Web Frameworks</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Frontend Frameworks (for the client-side):</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Focus on building the user interface and enhancing user experience.</li>
                    <li>Examples: React, Angular, Vue.js.</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Backend Frameworks (for the server-side):</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Focus on server-side logic, database handling, and API creation.</li>
                    <li>Examples: Django, Flask, Ruby on Rails, Express.js.</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Full-Stack Frameworks:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Combine both frontend and backend tools for a complete web development solution.</li>
                    <li>Examples: Meteor, ASP.NET, Laravel.</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
        </ul>

        <h2>Types of Web Frameworks</h2>
        <p>
            There are two main functions of frameworks for websites: to work on the <em>server side (backend)</em>, or on the <em>client-side (frontend)</em>, corresponding to their type. This division is not complicated and looks like this:
        </p>

        <h3>Server-side (Backend)</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Server-side frameworks</strong>. The rules and architecture of these frameworks allows you to create simple pages, landings and forms of different types. However, in order to build a web application with a well-developed interface, you should have a wider functionality. These frameworks can also form the output data and improve security in case of web attacks. All of these can definitely simplify the development process. Server-side frameworks work mostly on particular but important details without which an application can’t work properly. Here are top backend frameworks and the languages they work in:
            <ul>
                <li>Django – Python</li>
                <li>Zend – PHP</li>
                <li>Express.js – Javascript</li>
                <li>Ruby on Rails – Ruby</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Client-side (Frontend)</h3>
        <p>
            Unlike the server side, client-side frameworks have nothing to do with business logic. Their work takes place inside the browser. Thus, one can improve and implement new user interfaces. Numerous animated features can be created with frontend frameworks as well as SPA (single-page applications). Each of the client-side frameworks differs in function and use. For comparison purposes, here they are:
            <ul>
                <li>Backbone+Marionette</li>
                <li>Angular</li>
                <li>Ember.js</li>
                <li>Vue.js</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Why Use a Web Framework?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Efficiency</strong>: Handles common development tasks, reducing repetitive coding.</li>
            <li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Provides structure and tools to build scalable applications.</li>
            <li><strong>Security</strong>: Includes built-in features to protect against common security vulnerabilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Consistency</strong>: Encourages a standardized way of organizing code.</li>
            <li><strong>Community Support</strong>: Popular frameworks often have a large community, extensive documentation, and plugins or extensions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Benefits and Trade-offs</h2>
        <p>Benefits:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reduces development time.</li>
            <li>Encourages best practices and standardization.</li>
            <li>Provides ready-to-use components.</li>
            <li>Offers support for scalability and security.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Trade-offs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Learning curve, especially for complex frameworks.</li>
            <li>May impose constraints, limiting flexibility.</li>
            <li>Overhead from unused features in monolithic frameworks.</li>
        </ul>
