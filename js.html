        <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>JavaScript</strong> often abbreviated as <strong>JS</strong>, is a programming language and core technology of the World Wide
            Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 99% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior,
            often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to
            execute the code on users' devices.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>JavaScript</strong> is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multiparadigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
        </p>
        <p>
            The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
        </p>
        <p>
            JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.
        </p>


        <h2>Website Client-side Usage</h2>
        <p>
            JavaScript is the dominant client-side scripting language of the Web, with 99% of all websites using it for this purpose.[10] Scripts are embedded in or included from HTML documents and interact with the DOM.
        </p>
        <p>
            All major web browsers have a built-in JavaScript engine that executes the code on the user's device.
        </p>
        <p>
            Examples of Scripted Behavior
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Loading new web page content without reloading the page, via Ajax or a WebSocket. For example, users of social media can send and receive messages without leaving the current page.
            </li>
            <li>
                Web page animations, such as fading objects in and out, resizing, and moving them.
            </li>
            <li>
                Playing browser games.
            </li>
            <li>
                Controlling the playback of streaming media.
            </li>
            <li>
                Generating pop-up ads or alert boxes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Validating input values of a web form before the data is sent to a web server.
            </li>
            <li>
                Logging data about the user's behavior then sending it to a server. The website owner can use this data for analytics, ad tracking, and personalization.
            </li>
            <li>
                Redirecting a user to another page.
            </li>
            <li>
                Storing and retrieving data on the user's device, via the storage or IndexedDB standards.
            </li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Web Libraries and Frameworks</h2>

        <h3>React</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>React</strong> (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a
            community of individual developers and companies.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>React</strong> can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like <strong>Next.js</strong>. Because React is only concerned with the user interface and rendering components to the DOM, React applications often rely on libraries for routing and other client-side functionality. A key advantage of React is that it only rerenders those parts of the page that have changed, avoiding unnecessary rerendering of unchanged DOM elements.
        </p>

        <h3>Angular</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Angular</strong> (also referred to as "Angular 2+") is a <strong>TypeScript-based</strong>, free and open-source single-page web application framework led by the Angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and corporations. Angular is a complete rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS.
        </p>

        <h3>jQuery</h3>
        <p>
            In 2012, <strong>jQuery</strong> was by far the most popular client-side library, used by over 75% of websites. While still in widespread use, its popularity has been surpassed by newer libraries and frameworks.
        </p>
        
        <h3></h3>
        <h3>Vanilla JS</h3>
        <p>
            The framework-like moniker "<strong>Vanilla JS</strong>" is term that has been coined for websites not using any libraries or frameworks at all, instead relying entirely on standard JavaScript functionality.
